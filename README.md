# ISO 20022 Software Developer Kit (SDK)

The `iso-20022-sdk` is a Rust library for working with ISO 20022 messages.

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
iso-20022-sdk = { version = "0.1.0" }

```

> #
> WARNING: This repository is actively under development. While we will do our best to maintain consistency and adequate deprecation notices, it is wise to expect breaking changes and use a static version in your dependencies.
> #

> #
> Read the [ISO 20022 SDK User Guide]() for usage examples and more information.

## Features

By default, `iso-20022-sdk` includes `nvlp`, `head` and `dsig` features, which imports `iso-20022-nvlp`, `iso-20022-head` and `iso-20022-dsig` respectively.

Documents, e.g. `remt.001.001.01`, are conditionally compiled and need to be added individually, either as a business domain or message set feature, e.g.

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
iso-20022-sdk = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["remt"] }
```

Now you can create a `Document` from the `remt.001.001.01` namespace:

```rust
use iso_20022_sdk::Document;

let mut doc = Document::from_namespace("remt.001.001.01")?;

```

### Business Domains

To include messages relevant only to the `payments` business domain, add the `payments` feature to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
iso-20022-sdk = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["payments"] }

```

Using the `payments` features will include all message sets in the `payments` business domain:

```toml
payments = ["acmt", "auth", "acmt", "admi", "camt", "pacs", "pain", "reda", "remt"]
```

> Available business domain `features`
> 
> - `payments`
> - `securities`
> - `trade`
> - `cards`
> - `fx`


### Message Sets

Each message set, e.g. `acmt`, has its own Rust library, e.g. `iso-20022-acmt`, which can be conditionally compiled using the `Cargo.toml` **features** flag corresponding to the message set. 


```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
iso-20022-sdk = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["acmt", "admi"] }

```
